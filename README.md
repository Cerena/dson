Dvora's Serialized Object Notation


Welcome to DSON! DSON is the next generation of serialization technology. Expect to see DSON popping up all over software 
scene.

_Ok, I already have a serialization framework, why DSON?_
+ DSON requires unnecessary characters!
+ DSON currently does not support nested data types!
+ DSON is awesome!

So now that you are as excited as we are, here's some sample DSON to get you started.

    {
     {dson="true"},
     {name="dson"},
     {type="serialization framework"},
     {age=0},
     {awesomeness="unmeasureable"}
    }

__DSON FAQ__

_How was DSON created?_
DSON was created during a conversation between Dvora (hence the name) and a coworker.  It went something like this:
+ Dvora: "I am trying to parse this string but I'm getting errors"
+ Coworker: "Why are you trying to parse this with substrings? Just use a JSON parser"
+ Dvora: "[Another coworker] said I can't"
+ Coworker: "Why not?"
+ Dvora: "I can't remember"

When the JSON parser failed, DSON was born!

_Who uses DSON?_
DSON is the ideal serialization technology for any application. DSON is used all over industry as well as in many 
personal development projects.  Currently, DSON is being used by the following companies and projects:

_How can DSON be this awesome?_

We aren't sure but we are excited!
